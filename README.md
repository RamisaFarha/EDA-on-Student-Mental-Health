Exploratory Data Analysis on Student Mental Health
# Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis on Student Mental Health

## 1. Introduction
The aim of this data analysis project is to perform an exploratory data analysis on the student mental health dataset and gain insights into various factors related to mental health among students. The dataset contains information about students' age, gender, course, current year of study, depression status, and their experiences seeking specialist treatment. This report presents the findings and key observations obtained through exploratory data analysis.

## 2. Data Overview
The dataset consists of 101 rows and 11 columns. The key columns in the dataset include age, timestamp, gender, course of study, depression status, and current year of study. The data types range from numerical variables (such as Timestamp, Age, Current year of study, and CGPA) to categorical variables (such as Gender, Course of study, Marital status, Depression, Anxiety, and Panic attack).

## 3. Data Exploration
In the initial exploration of the dataset, we assessed its structure, including the number of rows and columns. We also examined the column names and data types to familiarize ourselves with the dataset.

## 4. Data Analysis
### 4.1. Age Distribution
### 4.2. Gender Distribution
### 4.3. Course of Study
### 4.4. Depression Status
### 4.5. Current Year of Study
### 4.6. Seeking Specialist Treatment

## 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, this exploratory data analysis project shed light on various factors related to student mental health. The findings revealed patterns and distributions of age, gender, course of study, depression status, current year of study, and seeking specialist treatment. These findings can serve as a foundation for further research and interventions aimed at addressing student mental health.

## 6. Limitations
It is important to acknowledge certain limitations of this analysis. The findings are based on the provided dataset, which may not be representative of the entire student population. The self-reported nature of the data and potential biases or missing information could affect the accuracy and generalizability of the findings. Further research and analysis are recommended to validate and expand upon these initial findings.

## 7. Future Directions
Future research could involve more in-depth analysis of specific factors affecting student mental health, such as the impact of academic stress, social support systems, and campus resources. Additionally, predictive modeling and machine learning techniques could be applied to develop models that can identify students at risk of mental health issues and provide targeted interventions. This project provides a valuable starting point for understanding student mental health, and it highlights the importance of ongoing research and support initiatives to promote student well-being.
